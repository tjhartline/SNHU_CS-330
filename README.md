# SNHU_CS-330
Projects and Coursework from CS330, Computer Graphics Design and Visualization

This repository contains any reflection and summary assignments, and the final project I submitted for the course. For my final project, I was required to combine all the techniques learned throughout the course, to compile and run a program that renders a 3D image. 

For my scene, I chose to create an ice-cream cone sitting on a tabletop, with a moon as the lightsource for my scene. I added lighting, shadows, camera movement, applied 3 different textures, and even included reflections of the textures that bounce to the moons surface, dependent upon the camera position in the scene. 

This was all done using (new to me), Modern OpenGL, and GLSL. It is coded in C++, and was programmed in Visual Studio 2019 IDE.

While I was new to OpenGL, and unfamiliar with all things related to graphic design, I was able to learn quite alot over the seven weeks, and create a completely functional 3D scene using nothing more than code and mathematics, which I am very proud of!

While the reflection addition was not a requirement, nor a part of the lesson plan, due to me misinterpreting the instruction rubric, I learned to do add them. Here is a link to my video of the different reflections and lighting I was able to create and render in my program: https://youtu.be/9JjasCed6Kk

**FINAL REFLECTION**
Approach to Designing Software:
I approached software design by selecting objects that aligned with the project's requirements, balancing visual appeal and complexity. I considered the modularity of my code through functions, and my use of shaders, textures, and lighting reflects a design focused on creating a visually polished 3D scene.

New Design Skills Acquired:
My work on this project has honed my skills in designing modular code structures, integrating textures and shaders for realistic rendering, and arranging objects within a 3D space to form a coherent scene.

Design Process Followed:
My design process involved selecting suitable objects, arranging them, and implementing navigation and camera controls. I used a modular approach, employing custom functions for various tasks. Additionally, I iteratively refined my design as I tackled lighting, shaders, and textures.

Applying Design Tactics in the Future:
The modular design and structured functions I employed can be applied to future projects, enhancing code reusability and maintainability. Considering the visual and experiential aspects while designing software can lead to more engaging and polished user experiences.

Approach to Developing Programs:
I approached program development systematically, incrementally building and refining different components of the scene. I combined code for rendering, navigation, and controls, making sure each aspect works harmoniously.

New Development Strategies Used:
My development strategies included creating custom functions for rendering, navigation, and camera control. I leveraged iteration to fine-tune lighting, textures, and camera behavior for a cohesive outcome.

Iteration in Development:
Iteration played a significant role in my development process. I iteratively adjusted camera movement, lighting parameters, and shader effects to achieve the desired visual quality and interactivity.

Evolution of Code Development Approach:
My approach evolved from focusing on individual components in earlier milestones to integrating those components into a coherent whole for the final project. This evolution showcased my ability to synthesize diverse elements into a comprehensive application.

Role of Computer Science in Goal Achievement:
Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, and programming expertise. These skills empower me to tackle complex challenges, develop innovative solutions, and create software that aligns with my goals.

Knowledge from Computational Graphics and Visualizations:
My work with computational graphics and visualizations has given me skills in creating realistic virtual environments, which can be applied in fields like video game development, architectural visualization, and simulation. These skills can enhance my educational path by providing hands-on experience with real-world applications.

Professional Application of Computational Graphics:
Computational graphics and visualizations are essential in industries like entertainment, architecture, and product design. By mastering these skills, I'll be well-equipped to contribute to projects involving 3D modeling, visualization, and simulation, making me a valuable asset in various professional pathways.
