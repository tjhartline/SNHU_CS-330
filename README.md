# SNHU_CS-330
Projects and Coursework from CS330, Computer Graphics Design and Visualization

This repository contains any reflection and summary assignments, and the final project I submitted for the course. For my final project, I was required to combine all the techniques learned throughout the course, to compile and run a program that renders a 3D image. 

For my scene, I chose to create an ice-cream cone sitting on a tabletop, with a moon as the lightsource for my scene. I added lighting, shadows, camera movement, applied 3 different textures, and even included reflections of the textures that bounce to the moons surface, dependent upon the camera position in the scene. 

This was all done using (new to me), Modern OpenGL, and GLSL. It is coded in C++, and was programmed in Visual Studio 2019 IDE.

While I was new to OpenGL, and unfamiliar with all things related to graphic design, I was able to learn quite alot over the seven weeks, and create a completely functional 3D scene using nothing more than code and mathematics, which I am very proud of!

While the reflection addition was not a requirement, nor a part of the lesson plan, due to me misinterpreting the instruction rubric, I learned to do add them. Here is a link to my video of the different reflections and lighting I was able to create and render in my program: https://youtu.be/9JjasCed6Kk
